# ADS1115Runner
Pure Python sample code for ADS1115 on Raspberry Pi

This code does *not* use AdaFruit libraries and is to demonstrate some capabilities of the  ADS1115 with a test circuit.
More information can be found on my homepage https://smartypies.com/projects/ads1115-with-raspberrypi-and-python/ .

ADSLooper.py uses ADSRunner.py foundations to realize alternate readings of AIN0 and AIN1 against ground.
